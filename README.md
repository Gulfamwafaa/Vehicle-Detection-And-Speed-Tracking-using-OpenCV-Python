# Vehicle-Detection-And-Speed-Tracking-using-OpenCV-Python
This project contains a Python script for tracking vehicles in a video and estimating their speed using the OpenCV and dlib libraries.
This script reads a video, detects and tracks cars using Haar Cascade and dlib's correlation tracker, estimates their speeds, and displays the results on the frames.  
# To run the project:
Download the code or clone it  simply run:
$ git clone https://github.com/Gulfamwafaa/Vehicle-Detection-And-Speed-Tracking-using-OpenCV-Python
To install required dependencies, run:
$ cd Vehicle-Detection-And-Speed-Tracking-using-OpenCV-Python/
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you change the line of detection and lane segmentation according to your video and fine tune the threshold and confidence for YOLO model

# Vehicle-Detection-And-Speed-Tracking-using-OpenCV-Python
This project contains a Python script for tracking vehicles in a video and estimating their speed using the OpenCV and dlib libraries.
This script reads a video, detects and tracks cars using Haar Cascade and dlib's correlation tracker, estimates their speeds, and displays the results on the frames.
